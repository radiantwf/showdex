  /**
   * Names/usernames of individuals within the supporter tier.

   * * If the element is a `string` (& not the `[name, user?, start?, end?]` tuple),
   *   the name will be implicitly treated as if `user` is `false`.
   * * When the `term` of the tier is `'once'`, the `start` & `end` elements of the tuple
   *   will be ignored as it only applies to `'monthly'` terms.
   * * When the `term` is `'monthly'` & the `end` element is specified, the name will
   *   appear faded in the `PatronagePane`.
   *   - More specifically, the opacity of the name will be set to `0.5` (i.e., 50%).
   * * For tuple elements in `names`, the `start` & `end` elements are both ISO 8601 date strings.
   *   - For `'once'` terms, only the `start` date is used to display the date of donation.
   *     (If `end` is provided for whatever reason, it will be ignored.)
   *   - For `'monthly' terms, the length of the term is determined by the `start` date up until
   *     the build date (`process.env.BUILD_DATE`) or the `end` date, whichever comes first.
   * * Specify the `user` value in the tuple as `true` if the `name` is a Showdown username.
   *   - This will allow the user's profile to appear when clicked on via `openUserPopup()`.
   *   - This logic also occurs in `PatronagePane`.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * [
   *   'Active Patron', // by default for strings, user = false (implicit)
   *   ['Another Active Patron', false], // user = false (explicit)
   *   ['ActivePatronUsername', true, '2023-04-20T04:20:00Z'], // user = true (explicit)
